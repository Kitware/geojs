### Breaking changes
- The global `inherit` function has moved to `geo.inherit`

## Version 0.8.0

### Major changes
- Quad features have been created as a replacement for plane features.  They can draw multiple convex quadrilaterals with images or solid colors as textures within a single feature instantiation.  These features also support default styles or images that display while asynchronous resources load.
- A new [quad example](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/quads/) demonstrates the new capabilities of the quad feature.
- A new [reprojection example](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/reprojection/) demonstrates how quad features can be used to reproject a standard tile layer.  It also provides an additional example of using mouse events on point features to display textual information in a popup box and to recenter the map on click.
- UI Layers will now automatically remain on top when adding new layers.
- Migrated to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) from jshint/jscs for style checking.

### Performance improvements

Migrating from the plane feature to the new quad feature provides major performance gains for the GL tile layer.  @manthey provided some [benchmarks](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs/pull/528#issuecomment-180411371) in his PR demonstrating how much this improves performance on a variety of platforms.  Here is an summary of the improvements he measured:

| Test | Average frame (ms) | Slow frames (%) | Worst frame (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| desktop-chrome-plane | 12.69 | 24.59 | 84.9 |
| desktop-chrome-quad | 3.31 | 0.44 | 20.74 |
| destop-firefox-plane | 55.25 | 55.52 | 1316.73 |
| destop-firefox-quad | 7.5 | 3.82 | 41.04 |
| laptop-chrome-plane | 25.55 | 60.21 | 157.15 |
| laptop-chrome-quad | 3.89 | 3.31 | 62.62 |
| laptop-firefox-plane | 130.04 | 95.71 | 1126.31 |
| laptop-firefox-quad | 21.92 | 91.1 | 67.21 |

## Version 0.7.0

### New features
- Maps can now be rotated either through the [javascript API](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs/blob/release-0.7.0/src/core/map.js#L416-L426) or by pressing `Ctrl` while dragging or using the mouse wheel.
- The Tile Layer example allows turning on or off rotations or restricting rotations to specific orientations.
- A new renderer fallback API supports querying support for a renderer and falling back to a different supported renderer.  The default OSM layer now supports this mechanism falling back to a raw HTML interface when webGL is not available.

### Bug fixes
-  The [Deepzoom example](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/deepzoom/) was mistakenly using the HTML renderer.
- Fixed several race conditions involved in loading and purging tiles
- The tile cache will now automatically grow when it is not large enough to contain all of the tiles in use

### Testing
- Unit tested code coverage is now up to 62% from 42% at version 0.6.

## Version 0.6.0

### New features and API additions
- Completely new tile layer class that moves formally GL specific code into core
  - Maps no longer require GL or even a base layer

- [Choropleth](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/choropleth/) feature type
- New API for [widgets](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/widgets/)
- New [example](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/tiles/) showing off the features available for tile layers
- GeoJSON reader now supports [Polygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#polygon) and [Multipolygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#multipolygon) geometries
- Layers can now be reordered dynamically
- Added a new mouse event (`click`) that detects mouse clicks on the map canvas
- The map interactor can be disabled temporarily to cede control of the mouse and keyboard events to external handlers
- Support for subdomains in tile url template strings
- Opacity controls are now supported by all layer types
- Map "origin" parameter provides a fixed offset for world coordinates to support higher precision at high zoom levels
- New map option (`clampZoom`) to limit zoom levels to a given range
- New `osmLayer` option (`tileRounding`) to control which tiles are loaded at non-integer zoom levels

### API changes
- Web mercator (`EPSG:3857`) coordinates are now in units of meters rather than degrees
- Lower resolution tiles are loaded before high resolution tiles
  - Creates the perception of faster load times
  - Greatly reduces the occurrence of background visibility while tiles load
- Removed the per-layer geographic projection attribute (`layer.gcs`) that was never fully implemented
  - Every layer is now expected to render in the map's world coordinate system
  - Feature layers can define a "local" coordinate system that is used internally
  - Tile layers have an additional coordinate system defined for each displayable zoom level
- Removed `geo.mercator` in favor of a generic projection class based on PROJ4
- Tile URL template strings now use the more common curly brackets (`{x}`) rather than angle brackets (`<x>`)
- Nearly all of the internals of the `osmLayer`

### Performance
- A tile fetch queue now prioritizes downloaded tiles by what is currently in view
- Mouse event handlers are now throttled to fire at most every 30 ms
- Compiled GL shaders are now cached and shared between features
- Configurable tile cache size

### Testing
- A new library of "mocked" classes has been started to mock interfaces between the classes inside unit tests.
- All new core classes have unittest coverage over 80% and many more classes now have coverage over 50%

### Infrastructure and building
- Continuous coverage reporting of unit tests submitted to [CDash](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=geojs)
- VGL submodule removed in favor of inclusion via bower
- Support for installing as the `root` user
- Data used for testing and examples are now hosted at [data.kitware.com](https://data.kitware.com/)
- The library is no longer built automatically after `npm install` to fix [downstream build problems](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs/pull/461).

### Bug fixes
- Setting camera bounds now uses the correct coordinate system
- GeoJSON polygon features no longer rendered as lines
- Discrete zoom now works with touch-like devices
- The `planeFeature` now handles coordinate transformations
- Rendering operations (such as loading new tiles) now occur during map navigation and transition events

### Known issues
- Several [performance problems](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aperformance+) have been exposed by rendering new tiles during map navigations
  - Many garbage collections occur during mouse handlers due to excessive memory allocations
  - Shader programs are not shared among tiles so they need to be linked for each tile
